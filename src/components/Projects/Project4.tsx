                        <text className="project-description">Within this project, I repurposed a 500W Computer Power Supply Unit (PSU) from an old computer from a street cleanup to be my lab-bench DC power supply. This power supply came with in-built short circuit protection, hence creating me a high power lab-bench DC power supply which can produce a range of voltages from -12V to 12V.</text>

                            <li className="process-element">All the wires of the PSU were stripped and separated, after which all the colours indicating power rails, Orange (+3.3V), Red (+5V), Yellow (+12V), Blue (-12V) and Black (Ground), were grouped and soldered together, with the the ground being soldered in two separate groups each with half of the total number of ground wires.</li>
                            <li className="process-element">After this, the PSU case was drilled to make space for the banana plugs and power switch</li>

This enabled them to be safely screwed onto their respective banana connectors and become operational</li>
